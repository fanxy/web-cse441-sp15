Security 6-4
Final Exam Review

Buffer Overflows
 - printf has a few variations

Defenses
 - mark all writeable memory locations as non-executable
 - stack canaries

 Fuzz Testing
  - randomly put strings into program -> see if program crashes
  	- pro = don't really need to know, black box fuzzing
  	- cons = try all the different if branches and see if interesting things happen


Cryptography
 - know pros and cons between the two types (asymmetric and symmetric)
 - encrypting a larger message need to chain together
 	- can use ECB, CBC, or CTR
	- *** REVIEW pros and cons of each
 - How can a cipher be attacked?
 	- different level of severity of attack
		 - attacker knows ciphertext and encryption algorithm
 		 1. ciphertext-only
 		 2. KPA
 		 3. CPA - choose what the system can use
 		 4. CCA 
 		 - **know an example for each of the above

 - Hash Functions
 	 - collision resistance (hard to find 2 that collide)
 	 - weak collision resistance
 	 - one-way
	 - Why do we hash passwords instead of encrypting? if you encrypt you have to store the keys, hashpasswords use a salt to make it more difficult to brute force

 - Exchanging keys
 	 - ***KNOW THE FORMULAS

 - RSA Cryptosystem
 - Key Distribution

Web security
 - different types of attacks
 - how they works
 -
